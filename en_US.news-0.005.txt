For Romney, a Michigan defeat would be disastrous. Romney was born in Detroit and raised in Bloomfield Hills, an upscale suburb. In 2008, he won the Michigan primary by a comfortable nine-point margin over McCain.

The format feels familiar at first, because we've seen countless bands profiled through their rise, fall and struggles to remain relevant on the old VH1 show "Behind the Music." But Anderson and Metzler break through that show's often-shallow approach, with the band offering incredible access to its creative process and, perhaps more surprisingly, its members problems, both personal and professional. It's a refreshing approach; the warts-and-more-warts style somehow makes the film ultimately more uplifting.

* Don and Megan's Short, Strange Trip: Raise your hand if you also thought the projector had gotten the reels out of order (speaking of a '60s reference) when we saw Don getting excited about heading to Howard Johnson's with Megan. It took me several moments to figure out that this was the playing-out of the fleeting reference we'd seen earlier in the episode, as Roger's LSD storyline was beginning. Anyway, Don once again bullies past Megan's protestations -- she feels bad ditching Peggy and the rest of the Heinz team -- and insists she accompany him on the trip to Howard Johnson's. She complies, but is clearly not happy. As Don, in his own world of domestic bliss, tells her she must try the orange sherbet, she objects to his smoking in the car. And things go downhill from there. At the blandly cheery HoJo's, Don keeps wanting things his way, until Megan finally blows up. "Maybe you could make up a schedule for me so I'll know when I'm working, and when I'm the wife," she says. The fight continues to the parking lot, with Megan saying, "Get in the car, eat ice cream, leave work, take off your dress. Yes, master!" So much for the newlywed glow Roger had so envied. Instead of talking it out, Don gets in the car, and drives off, leaving Megan in the parking lot. Once he cools off and returns, she's gone. He waits, getting more frazzled by the moment, at HoJo's, but there's no sign of Megan. Finally, seven hours later, he heads home, and finds Megan there. They fight again, her yelling at him for leaving her there, him saying he thought she was dead. She tries to run away, but he follows her, and they both tumble onto the carpet. But the mood is very different from the beginning of the season, when we saw them in this same position after having had sex.

Suddes lamented the loss of rebels who he says are being shown the door due to term limits. I would submit that a more likely culprit of legislative ills and fewer rebels is the aggressive actions taken by both the Republican and Democratic parties to handpick candidates and involve themselves in primaries to ensure their guy or gal wins. This practice breeds extreme loyalty to the parties and their leadership, but leaves we the people in the back seat.
"I thought we battled pretty hard and I think we deserved a little bit better than that," Elliott said. "But you've got to work for your chances. We had a lot of stuff from the outside and couldn't really get to the interior of the ice. We know what we need to do - it's just going out there and doing it.

Vinny's extended family also shows up and treats the house to some delicious ziti and cold cuts, then Mama Guadagnino cleans the refrigerator.

The whole point of becoming self sufficient in energy — as well as importing crude from friendly Canada — is to become indifferent to crude purchased from countries that want to destroy us. Oil prices are set by global demand. If we produced additional crude so that global productive capacity is in excess of demand, world crude prices would fall, and as Mr Corredoira correctly observes, OPEC would be forced to cut production to maintain prices. However, OPEC members are not all equals in terms of production and population. Countries such as Nigeria cannot cut production because they have an immediate need for cash.
Others say the economy is too fragile to give up. In recent weeks, Wall Street economists and academics have suggested the government could back the refinancing of all homes with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other government entities.

A gas tax increase won't be the only transportation revenue measure on the table this January. The panel is also expected to propose raising vehicle registration fees by 50 percent and doubling vehicle emission testing charges. Why these fees are considered less controversial is a wonder. In 2004, then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. persuaded lawmakers to boost biennial registration fees on passenger cars from $81 to $128 and on sport utility vehicles and trucks from $108 to $180 and was toasted as a pro-business conservative Republican.

Republicans have a 33-32 vote advantage in the House. But given the committee votes, where Republicans joined Democrats, the bill could have enough support for passage.
First, the 2 percent increase in undergraduate tuition and room and board is lower than in years past, and should allow us to meet anticipated mandated cost increases - such as Jesuit affirmative action hires and student disability services - as well as increases in the cost of other services and products we purchase. Consequently, there is a very limited amount of money for new spending. This budget sends a message to our students and their families that we are aware of the financial realities they are facing.

Role: The former No. 1 overall draft pick will start the season exactly as he has lingered most of this professional career -- injured. Oden, who has played in just 82 games since being drafted in 2007, is unsure when he will return to the court as he continues to rehab from December knee surgery. When healthy, Oden is a potential difference-maker who can wreak havoc on defense and provide a needed post threat on offense. But his health remains a big if, and he is arguably the biggest question mark entering the season.
"He's an excellent pick-and-roll player," Thibodeau said. "He can push the ball in transition. He's a terrific 3-point shooter. He has good quickness. And he knows how to run the team.

Those turbines must be available all the time, adding to the cost of electricity.

LifeBUILDERS is a faith-based group. That needs to be said. Many of the activities and philosophies revolve around a Christian point of view. But the idea of a nurturing community does not belong to any one religion. And the idea of taking over abandoned buildings and turning them into thriving homes should not be pigeonholed by a category.
Breakfast for dinner was always a treat at our house when I was growing up. My dad was not a big fan of it (though he loved breakfast for breakfast), so if he had a meeting or was out of the house at dinner time, my mom would let us indulge.

"You can't control what other people say," Groce told the paper. "You can only control what you're doing on a daily basis. That's how we operate here, and I can assure you that's how coach Matta operates in Columbus. For me, it's almost comical. They're going to say what they're going to say."

The grand prize was awarded to Rosa Davidson and Carmella Baldassare, who entered as part of the 8 — 10 year old age category. Rosa and Carmella painted an evocative scene of a turtle in a beautiful pond with cat tails. Reminiscent of the "Crying Indian" campaign in 1970, featuring Chief Iron Eyes Cody and the tagline "People start pollution. People can stop it," the turtle was crying as it looked at the discarded litter in the pond and a plastic bag floating in the air.
There simply wasn't enough evidence things were headed in the right direction to warrant staying the course. Spagnuolo's defensive scheming was never in question. His game management came under fire at times, however, and the Rams struggled to win when games were close in fourth quarters.

4) Eli Roth's Hostel: Hunting Season -- The extreme gore maze starts in a queue where a pair of prostitutes invite you into a European youth hostel with a terrible, dark secret. Among my favorite scenes: the twitching upside-down victim spurting "blood" at visitors, the crazed guy emerging from beneath a pile of body parts and the barking dog puppets popping out of a hallway wall. My only complaint: At times, the Hostel maze felt like just another installment of the Saw maze from the previous two years. Just like the Alice Cooper maze, hit Hostel early in the evening before the crowds descend to the lower lot.

There are some one-of-a-kind attractions, too. Like “Rock of Ages,” the mullet-and-power-ballad Broadway hit, now with Tom Cruise.

SANTA CRUZ - In a muted conclusion to a case the prosecutor calls devastating, a 23-year-old man was sentenced Tuesday to 31 years in prison for the homicide of Santa Cruz teen Tyler Tenorio.
But Manning decided to visit Denver first. Elway low-keyed the approach during the discussions, answered the critical questions and asked the correct questions. On their follow-up trip to North Carolina last Friday to watch Manning's arm and examine his body, Elway was the calm catalyst. Other teams were eliminated early, and the Broncos became one of the four favorites, then three. When the Dolphins and the Cardinals were replaced by the Titans and the 49ers as contenders, the Broncos held steady and hoped.
What happened: Braves relief pitcher Rick Camp hit a home run, the only of his career, in the 18th inning to tie an epic game with the Mets at 11-11. The Mets would win the game in the 19th inning.

Any of the fans seemingly trapped at the bottom of Sections 103 and 104 could have easily walked up the area stairway, spilled into the concourse, and located an exit that would have led to the parking garage. What was really blocked by that rope was the shorter and more glamorous exit route that led from the courtside seats through the arena tunnel, past the Courtside Lounge bar and bowels of the arena, where exiting fans sometimes catch a glimpse of an NBA player, out to the parking garages.
The vibe at the port-a-potties with the yelling and the cowbells was downright fall-of-Saigon-ish. Middle-aged women wearing spandex and shouting "the bus!" went flying out of the plastic booths, leaving the doors to slam behind them.

This is classic Allen — longtime fans will remember the wonderful “A Twenties Memory” from “Getting Even” — but it gets a nice twist by casting Owen Wilson in the lead. That immediately detours things in a fresh, Laid-back Dude direction instead of down the usual Angsty New Yorker avenues.
There seems to be no doubt that Mr. Edwards intended to keep his affair and his love child secret from his wife and from the American public, and that he enlisted Mr. Young to help in the cover up. But adultery, mendacity and generally loathsome behavior are not enough to warrant 30 years in jail. That, and a $1.5 million fine are the maximum penalty Mr. Edwards faces if federal prosecutors win this case.

Q: I'm not sure I can accept that numbers separate reality from fiction. Often, the source of those numbers can be troubling. The Labor Department reports jobless and jobs created or lost monthly and the financial world reacts quickly. This is despite the fact that revisions are almost a certainty and could go either way. I would like your research and views on how these numbers are created. -- Cliff Eggleton, Brecksville

Alas, Santorum also appears to be squarely in the mainstream among GOP presidential candidates now, offering a fiscal plan that's heavy on tax cuts and defense spending and light on real deficit reduction. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the plans offered by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and Mitt Romney would stop the federal debt from growing, but the ones offered by Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich would actually make it grow faster than it would under Washington's current policies. Rather than quibbling over nonissues from the past such as votes to raise the debt ceiling and to fund parochial highway projects, the candidates ought to spend more time critiquing one another's fiscal plans for the future.

4) Querétaro (2.02): Also among Mexico's smaller states, Querétaro is one of the most geographically varied, ranging from desert to tropical rainforest. The capital, Santiago de Querétaro, was designated the "third city of New Spain" in 1531 and is a trove for history buffs. It is best-known, however, for its role in ending Spanish rule. Overshadowing such momentous events as Maximilian's execution or the signing of the Treaty of Hidalgo and Mexican Constitution, its greatest source of pride is being the place where the fathers of independence plotted to overthrow the Spanish. Ecotourism is the mainstay of the Sierra Gorda biological reserve. The state also claims three of Mexico's major wineries and maintains a Cheese and Wine Museum.

I was trying to write this development down in my notebook when all of a sudden I went blind. A thick, lung-searing cloud of smoke had enveloped the section. I looked down and, amid the dancing feet, spotted a smoke bomb fizzing in a tin pail filled with sand. At least they are practicing responsible hooliganism, I thought. Then I heard the fire alarm go off.
"These fans here in Estonia are great," Eaton said. "They have such a great tradition of decathletes and really support the event. Ever since I stepped off the plane I liked this place.

A clean kick would have absolved them all — an offense that shut down in the third quarter, especially after Jeremy Shockey dropped a potential touchdown pass that should have made it a 42-14 lockup; and a defense that was so befuddled by 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia, every huddle included a half-dozen guys shouting “give us something” glances at defensive coordinator Johnny Lynn throughout the second half.

Like gray hair, wrinkles and the ability to remember your second-grade teacher's name but forget how you banged your shin this week, it's normal to bruise more frequently as you age. Your skin becomes thinner, and your capillaries (itsy-bitsy blood vessels) become more fragile, so a tiny bump can cause a bruise. And, yes, aspirin's blood-thinning effects intensify this. But thinner blood that doesn't clump up and clot easily is what you need and what your doc is after.

Still, it’s all a little absurd, and sometimes he revels in the absurdity. Go to his official (if rarely updated) web site, chrisnoth.net, and you’ll see a nice photo of the star. (“I wish I still looked like that.”)
It is discrimination at its best. Look at all of Dana Point's tourist promotion material – only the wealthy, young and buff need visit. Providing for the disabled would make the city very uncomfortable and not in keeping with their faux image.
Police do not believe a crime occurred, Mead said. They issued a public plea for help finding her because of Morgan's developmental disability.
Richard said Pfeffer was the first person to come to mind.
While I was growing up, we had a family business in the electronics industry, so I often quip that I started my career at age 7. We had wide-ranging dinner-table conversations, from science and technology to religion and politics. My whole family was technically inclined, and while I don't recall being excessively pushed in school, there was just an assumption in our family that we'd excel there.

Soon, we will gather around tables, taking care with the good china and folding the nice napkins. The smell of roasting turkey and bubbling gravy will mix with warm, fresh rolls. Pumpkin pie will sit on the counter, ready to be served. No doubt as soon as grace is said, someone will jump up from the table in search of a forgotten item. The broccoli, probably. Or maybe the sweet potatoes--the kind with marshmallows on top. It doesn't matter, something will be forgotten.
“He’s more like a philosopher who just happens to have a film crew with him,” Reilly says. “He’s an equal-opportunity truth collector — he’s just as interested in a bird flying by on the edge of the scene as he is in the lead actor. … So once he gets into the editing room, it’s not ‘What was I trying to see in this scene?’ It’s ‘What did I really see?’ ”
The star is Robert Downey Jr. His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony. (He was much better in the first "Iron Man," but he's quite good here.) "The Avengers," which takes place in murky darkness for the first half hour or so, begins to lighten up figuratively, if not literally, only when Iron Man appears and we see, on the lips of the man inside the red robotic rig, a faint smile that says "this is going to be fun." The fun in seeing his teammates lies mostly in watching them in action, although they quarrel comically among themselves at the outset like superdivas: "We're not a team," Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner says, "we're a time bomb."
We're in the car, my daughter in the back, me driving. Today was her first day of high school, and she tells me how Girl X, whom she's known since kindergarten, walked past her in the hall and didn't say Hi.
The best way to describe "Potiche" is breezy. It's a film so light that it might float off the screen and drift into the next theater. Ozon must have taken a happy pill.

Linda Wilson: No. The old Highway 115 bridge (St. Charles Rock Road) was removed because the Highway 370 bridge was built to replace it. The Highway 370 Missouri River bridge carries about 65,000 vehicles per day, so there is still a lot of room for it to carry more.

While you can't say Morgan pried any big revelations out of Oprah, you can definitely say he "won" the encounter (if it were even a contest in the first place).

Arizona and several other states argue they need to be able to conduct their own crackdowns on illegal immigration because the feds under President Obama's leadership have failed to do the job. Theirs is a states rights argument. Obama administration lawyers will insist this is a usurpation of the federal responsibility to set immigration policy. They argue that targeted enforcement, not random stops of Latinos to ask for their identification papers, is the best approach to the challenge.

Those tapas — if you want, call them pintxos, as they do in Perez's Basque homeland — are perfect for a quick bite or for sharing with a friend or two. A thick wedge of tortilla de patatas is Tweety Bird yellow from egg yolks, dotted with small chunks of potato. Sauteed field mushrooms arrive in a French canning jar. They're a little greasy but delicious with thin buttered toasts. Chicken wings confit are salty, sticky, tender: What a good idea for a tapa.

Another point of controversy is the poor ability of the U.S. to track cattle.

Before the advent of the euro, Germany's mark was Switzerland's main point of reference—including a period in the 1970s when the Swiss National Bank pegged the franc against the mark to rein in a surge in the Swiss currency. Today, as in the 1970s, Germany is Switzerland's largest trading partner, so a new Deutsche mark could in theory substitute for the euro, according to this person, although the bank is considering other scenarios, such as the formation of more than one currency bloc within Europe.
Bonello also gets too cutesy with quadruple screens, out-of-order scenes, modern music and touches (echoing Sofia Coppola's take on "Marie Antoinette"), and a languid pace that needlessly drags out the proceedings.

It all starts with Coples, a 6-foot-5, 285-pound defensive lineman from North Carolina who has a knack for the sack and creating commotions up front. Although many fans at the draft's site at Radio City Music Hall were chanting for the Jets to take South Carolina's Melvin Ingram at No. 16 overall, Coples might be better suited for what Ryan wants to do. And that, of course, is to be the league's No. 1 defense.

Yes, it does. Mr. Romney constantly talks about job losses under Mr. Obama. Yet all of the net job loss took place in the first few months of 2009, that is, before any of the new administration’s policies had time to take effect.

What happened: Many blame the central bank under Alan Greenspan for keeping interest rates too low and for boosting the nation's money supply too much. This created an easy-credit environment that encouraged less-qualified home buyers. It also created a period of such low yields that many investors sought better returns in securities backed by subprime mortgages. Critics also say the central bank encouraged investors to take too much risk because of its implied help in arranging bailouts � the �moral hazard� idea. A precedent was set when the Fed helped rescue a prominent hedge fund in 1998.

Kauai is one the most beautiful places on Earth — it's not for nothing it's called the Garden Isle —but it can be pricey. So how about a 1,000-square-foot apartment overlooking the Wailua River gorge, not 10 minutes from the ocean, complete with full kitchen, separate living room and bedroom, laundry facilities, and even a gorgeously landscaped swimming pool? And how about paying $110 to $130 a night?

Cars that can "see" the road, sense potential dangers and steer, brake and control speed automatically could ease the drudgery of stop-and-go traffic or long drives, and prevent many accidents caused by drowsy, inattentive or impaired drivers.

Portlanders in particularly steep parts of town pay more for garbage pickup. Homeowners on narrow West Hills side roads receive annual warnings that the city will not take extra steps to clear their streets of snow and ice.

At the very least, that's a debate in which the entire city should have participated.

5. Steve Stricker, United States -- Stricker had a chance to record his second victory of the season last week, but he ran out of steam on the back nine Sunday while closing with a 2-under-par 70 to finish solo sixth in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. It was his fourth top-10 result of the season on the PGA Tour and his best result since he captured the season-opening Hyundai Tournament of Champions. ... Stricker is taking another week off ahead of the Players Championship and is skipping the Wells Fargo Championship, which he has not played since 2008. He has played at Quail Hollow three times, missing the cut in 2003 and 2008 but finishing solo second in 2007. He played the weekend that year in 66-69, his only two rounds in the 60s on the course in eight tries, and finished two strokes behind Tiger Woods. ... Stricker played brilliant golf for 3 1/2 rounds last week at TPC Louisiana, posting rounds of 66-68-69 before playing the front nine in a flawless 3-under-par 33 on Sunday. However, he could manage only eight pars and a bogey, at No. 15, on the final nine to wind up four shots out of the playoff in which Jason Dufner beat Ernie Els. The back nine was his problem all week -- he played the front in a cumulative 15-under while struggling to a total of even par on the last nine holes. His putter was not as good as it usually is. After taking only 26 putts in the first round, he needed 29 on each of the last three days.

HARASSING COMMUNICATIONS, BENTLEYVILLE ROAD: Police in Moreland Hills and South Euclid are investigating a series of phone calls to determine who is harassing whom, after a village man initially reported April 14 that he had been receiving late night hang-up calls, followed by at least one mostly incoherent phone message.

The Moreland Hills man told police it may be a case of “mistaken identity.” South Euclid police said there may be a court case involving the two.

And the main cause for the not-yet-a-campaign meltdown? Kinder's alleged relationship with a former stripper in the 1990s, or maybe it was his want-to-be relationship. The extent of their connection, especially in more recent years, never really became clear. Which makes this even more interesting as some in the Republican party continue to stress social issues instead of focusing on more pressing economic, job-related challenges in the state.

That "debris" would have to kick up really high as that bear is three and a half to four feet high on all fours. What if it has risen to its full standing height in the attack mode of six to nine feet? Third: Some have alluded to noise. Wow, now that is a good idea. Mostly, noise merely signals the presence of someone who could be its next meal. Blow a whistle, ring a bell, start up your chain saw, it is all the same. People taste yummy and are easy prey. Not all guns will deter a bear either. It takes a well placed shot to do the job, There are even very special guns made especially to defend against the grizzly.

ANSWER: I had just finished graduate school and I was living in New Orleans. Actually, Bill Rhode, a friend of mine, had the idea to collect stories and he was interested in exploring how we might publish our work. It started off with us collecting stories from our friends, anonymous stories, most of them confessional in nature. We published four issues, and then we both left New Orleans in 1995, the same year we started. I went to Hamtramck, and he was pretty much done (with) it, but I kept on going.

It's been a couple of months since SOPA and PIPA became hot-button buzzwords of the Internet. How best to describe what they do? It's tempting to come up with an analogy to describe what it's meant to do and how it's meant to go about it. But that's dangerous; I'm convinced that an over-simplified analogy is what caused it to make as much progress as it did.

In contrast, "The King's Speech" though set in the 1930s was positioned by its Oscar campaign as a timeless story about friendship, loyalty and courage. And while characters can't get more elite than King George VI, his struggle for a voice made him far easier to relate to than anyone in "The Social Network." It played to rousing receptions at its first screenings at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals, and even Oscar producer Bruce Cohen emerged from an early showing declaring "The King's Speech" a shoo-in for a best picture nomination.

She told Glamour magazine: ''We're both independent people, so we can't have somebody around 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The drawback is that we can go weeks without seeing each other. But he's the only guy I've never had to worry about. Any guy I've ever dated, there would always be that doubt: 'He didn't answer his phone. What's he doing? It's late.'

Enlisting Brittany and Randa to play fellow victims, she vengefully accuses Mr. Anderson of sexual molestation after he strips her of the lead in Roxbury's production of "The Diary of Anne Frank."

I recently had the misfortune of seeing a veteran of the war in Afghanistan walk to the site of his suicide. He passed by me early in the afternoon in a Maryland state park where I was working, and I didn't realize until I saw his lifeless body later that day that I had seen him earlier. His wife told me that he was a veteran, that he suffered from PTSD and other mental illnesses, and that he had talked with her about taking his life. He chose a tranquil spot in the park, where water laps against the shore and a breeze always seems to blow. In doing so, he may have been seeking some respite from the trauma he had suffered. He left behind a wife and a baby.

The problem is that saying "I'm a geek lol!" is not the same as saying "I'm a doctor (lol)!" Geek is an ambiguous cultural distinction.

Some people argue we just need to try harder. That means spending more money. If we are currently intercepting about 10 percent of the drugs and spending about $15 billion on the drug war, does that mean we would have to increase the budget to $150 billion?

A well known public relations (PR) person recently told one of my colleagues "we don't need you anymore, we have facebook." That certainly prompted a few chuckles in our newsroom.

It was a little too rough to imagine being mass marketed, but that was its charm.
Under the terms, Hampton would plead guilty to reduced charges and be sentenced to 10 years in prison, said Cowan, William McDowell, who is Michael’s uncle; and Terry Lawson, his sister. Hampton would also be placed in witness protection for a time, they said. Because sentencing guidelines from 1978 would apply, Hampton would likely serve just two years before his release, McDowell said he was told.

The setting is ideal, since Stoker names Whitby as the place where the vampire first set foot on English soil, but that is the only bright spot in the plan. The first reading of the play is a disaster and artistic tempers flare. Then, a mysterious stranger arrives and,with him, murder.

"The robot is better," says Dr. Ricardo Estape, a gynecological surgeon at South Miami Hospital who helped start its robotic program.

* Newly appointed Smackdown general manager John Laurinaitis continued his crusade against superstars who supported Teddy Long by pitting R-Truth against the tandem of David Otunga and Mark Henry. The match was fairly short and pedestrian, as R-Truth had a chance to shine a little against Otunga, but once Henry entered, it was all but over. In the end, Otunga demanded Henry tag him in, so he could earn the pin, and Henry told Laurinaitis' right-hand man, "You owe me one." Could Otunga repay the favor by getting Henry a rightful rematch against WWE Champion CM Punk after the events of Raw?

Speaking of coffee, let's talk about the atmosphere. The sidewalk seating, with its umbrellas and people watching, nails it. (Well, our sidewalks are cleaner. Probably a good break from authenticity there.) But inside, there is a sterility of a TV-set coffeehouse. New Orleans is gritty. The dining room needs a little attitude. And it doesn't need a souvenir stand with overpriced trinkets. Seriously, the French Quarter tourist traps are not the part of New Orleans you want to emulate.

The Park Service faced similar questions in 1995, when it decided to bring wolves back to Yellowstone, but they were far less complicated, Smith said.

It’s been a problem that’s continued to grow. An annual homeless count, conducted on a single day in late January, found 12,569 homeless people across the state last year, up from 12,035 in 2009 and 10,947 in 2008. Advocates say that because of the survey’s limitations, the number of homeless people in the state is likely three to four times greater.

"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark," the former punch-line and now top-earning hit, might contend, even though it's been around for a long time.

We also want readers to find these recipes, which often appear in the Food section, a worthwhile addition to their own repertoire.

The sordid and delectable crowd together just as they do in the border city itself. In one piece, a woman stands with her arms raised overhead. A skeleton is traced atop her form like white icing. The man veering toward her with a dagger seems to be wearing an Aztec headdress, but his face, too, is reduced to a sketchy white cipher. Here the carnivalesque is ordinary, and the ordinary is carnivalesque. Signage self-captions many of the images, announcing what's on display, what's for sale.

When you reconnect with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time, it's only natural that you want to make the occasion kind of special. Maybe have them for dinner. In this case, literally.

Their camaraderie and cooking experience together helped give them an edge once the TV cameras started rolling.
Lodging on the island of Madeira runs the gamut from very casual (including rooms, or quartos, in private residences) to the very elegant. Reid's Palace, a popular spot for vacationing Brits, is majestically perched atop the cliffs; this is where Churchill came to paint and write after the war, and where Shaw learned to dance. Hotel employees were a little reticent to admit that this also is where the exiled president Batista stayed after he left Cuba, taking a whole floor of the hotel for himself and his entourage for about a year.
"... Indiana was unable to cite a single instance of actual voter impersonation at any point in its history," he wrote. "Likewise, in Kansas, there were far more reports of UFO sightings than allegations of voter fraud in the past decade. These theories of systematic fraud are really unfounded fears being exploited to threaten the franchise."
Cook, 39, of Apple Valley, is serving 25 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to running the fraud. Some 700 investors sunk $194 million into the bogus investment scheme before it collapsed in July 2009.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who visited Venezuela last week, announced that five of Russia's biggest oil companies are looking to form a consortium to increase Latin American operations and to build a $6.5 billion refinery to process Venezuela's tar-like heavy crude. Such an investment could help Venezuela, the world's ninth-biggest oil producer, wean itself from the U.S. refineries on which it depends to process much of its crude.
Now just about every dish is influenced by the South. During a recent visit I was surprised at how bold and delicious the menu has become, starting with an appetizer that should cause a national sensation: cornmeal-crusted oysters ($13). By themselves, they would win over the most headstrong loyalist, but Rosenthal sets them on a puddle of Herbsaint-scented pureed spinach nestled in the bottom of the shell and tops them with a precise zest of preserved lemon and a square of crisp-fried bacon. It's a symphony of tastes and textures - the crunch of cornmeal, the gush of oyster liquor, the kiss of citrus, the licorice-infused spinach and the salty meatiness of the bacon.

While no system is truly perfect, the current Illinois system is the simplest to apply and is working well enough with room for deviations and judicial discretion over many issues, including time spent with the child. In contrast, the proposed model opens up whole new issues for battling parents: A calculation would be required regarding two incomes (or lack thereof) and the comparisons. The proposed model presents an unworthy motive to seek the worthy goal of more time with children in that it appears to trade "dollars for days," as more than one commentator has observed.

Yeah, one of the reasons it took us so long to find distribution for it, is that it definitely walks a fine line between being a concert film and being a documentary about Tibet, and a documentary about the actual making of the concert and the event itself. It's actually a pretty elegant piece in how it walks that line.

Even in the cool 2011 vintage, Heredia stuck to her guns. Smart move. She pours me a sample from Pastorale, fermented with three-quarters of its stems. At barely 12 percent alcohol, it finds a balance of heady sage aromas and a dense texture. In the context of California Pinot, it is a radical, thought-provoking glassful, a sign that her style is exactly as she intends.

The police union president defends Nicholson, saying, "This shows now only how good a cop he is, but how important his family is to him. The same effort and energy he put into locating Phylicia Barnes, you can see him doing the same for his daughter. That's the kind of cop we want to patrol the streets of Baltimore."

It feels good to have their own place again, but the effect of the explosion is still present.
David Aldridge, NBA.com: "He's not a great shooter, but he's a slasher who can explode for points coming off screens. But he'll have to fight questions about whether he was just a good player on a bad team that didn't make the NCAAs.

Another likely factor in Schottenheimer's ouster was his decision to stand up to WR Santonio Holmes, who has been tagged as a problem in a locker room that turned sour this season. When Holmes began jogging through pass routes in a brazen display of non-hustle in the final regular-season game at Miami, Schottenheimer pulled him. The Jets can't cut Holmes because of his prohibitive contract, and the OC and the temperamental WR probably couldn't co-exist. So guess who had to go?

They do defensive tactics and scenario-based training at the Oregon National Guard's Camp Withycombe, about 12 miles away, and travel across Oregon for firearms training at several private gun clubs because the bureau can't reserve enough time at any one range to accommodate its nearly 1,000 officers
Yesterday, the brown-and-white pit bull weighed 51 pounds and was happy and healthy, said Pat Scavelli, the administrator at the Garden State Veterinary Specialists in Tinton Falls.
The year's most misunderstood album is also one of its best and most political. "Watch the Throne" is not just a celebration of opulence. It's also a challenge to the poor and mistreated to stand up and take control of the American project. That the challenge came from two of the wealthiest men in popular entertainment shouldn't come as a surprise to fans of rap music (or Occupy Wall Street) -- upward social mobility has always been central to hip-hop's ideology. Thanks to Jay-Z, the imperative to hustle for every dime has rarely been articulated as well as it is here, and thanks to Kanye West and his stable of producers, the beats gleam like a Maserati fresh from the paint shop. Heart-stopping cut: "Murder to Excellence," on which Jay tells his audience, "When you see me, see you."
On Saturday, Thomas Kinkade Co. officials sent a message to distributors that the business will continue, saying that "his art and powerful message of inspiration will live on."

"I wish we could have killed it," Paul said.
“For years, many of us have lived on the banks of the Rocky River Valley and spent many restful hours shaded by its trees, eating in the picnic areas and playing games in the generous open areas,” Knape said. “Is it possible that we have overlooked some significant matters related to this valley, and by this oversight have deprived us ourselves a deeper appreciation which many of us should have acquired some time ago?”
No one at the hospital was shot or injured, police said.
This year's tour stops include McCoy Stadium, the minor league baseball stadium in Pawtucket where Peter takes his Irish-Catholic father for a game; Narragansett Beer Company, a stand-in for the show's Pawtucket Patriot beer, in Providence; and Big Blue Bug Solutions, the pest control company with the giant blue bug on the roof, called Quahog Pest Control on Family Guy.

Last Christmas, someone named a star for Lindsey. Her parents wondered who had been so thoughtful. They asked relatives. They asked around town. They asked at the church. We posted a query on Lindsey's memorial Facebook page. No one came forward.
Developers would purchase and demolish several vacant, city-owned buildings as well as acquire and preserve a former Healthcare for the Homeless building on Park Avenue in hopes of starting construction within a year and a half.

A Belmont beginning
Chet's observation has been amplified a thousand times these days, viewing all the news, and all the news sources there are now. Indeed, it must be a very, very tough assignment for writer and producers in all forms of media to choose a lead story or to create even a "stack" in order of importance to a mass audience. The random thoughts I have to impart below are far from original, and won't make anyone's lead stories, but I think may be shared by a few people, to wit:
Product: About 360,000 Innovage Discovery Kids Animated Marine Lamp with model number 1627121 or 1628626 and Safari Lamps with model number 1627124 or 1628626. The lamps, which were imported by Innovage LLC of Foothill Ranch, Calif., feature rotating films with marine or safari scenes.

"When all is said and done, even though we're playing St. Louis, you want the best players playing, right?" Sutter said. "He's a top player, so it's no different than us with (Drew) Doughty; we want those guys playing. The league wants him playing; we want him playing."
"YRC has effectively abandoned the Project," ODOT wrote. It also noted that the list is not exhaustive. "It is illustrative of the fundamental and ongoing failures by YRC over the course of the Project from the time of its response to the request for proposals to the present day."

I agree with most of the points in the article. Ann Romney certainly has enjoyed a level of economic comfort that extremely few will ever know. However, I am not sure that you made any point or added anything to the discussion by mentioning the book and movie "The Help." ...
But when he travels to New York to make a speech before the United Nations, he finds he's been double-crossed by his right-hand man (Ben Kingsley) and forced to survive as a commoner. Stripped of his trademark thick beard, Aladeen is rendered unrecognizable and ends up working at an organic grocery store in Brooklyn run by the androgynous, ultra-politically correct Zoey (Anna Faris, who's nearly unrecognizable herself with short, dark hair).
Kapp said witnesses followed the vehicle to a nearby residence. Police located the vehicle and questioned the driver.
There was another swap when the Rams, who had the No. 6 pick after trading away the second pick to Washington last month, traded their choice for the Cowboys’ No. 14 overall pick. Dallas selected cornerback Morris Claiborne.
Pomeroy's steak with stinky-cheese toast ends up being one of his favorites, and Stone lauds her pairing, calling it "a brilliant idea."
This is the prime destination, a restaurant and resort that provide a sharp contrast to the tried-and-true and that can compete with its glitzy neighbors to the south. It's elegant and expensive, but diners can sit inside the impressive barnlike structure, nicely designed by Howard Backen, or outside overlooking the pool. You can have snacks, cocktails or any one of three meals supervised by Brandon Sharp, one of the Bay Area's top chefs. The menu is arranged in conventional fashion, but each category has dishes that are denoted as being lighter and those that are marked as heartier. On the lighter side, there might be halibut with hearts of peach palm and artichoke ravioli; for heartier dishes, there's leg of lamb with sausage, white beans and artichoke mint salsa verde.
In the days follwing the violence and destruction of April 1992, federal officials including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan walked the newly burned-out Vermont Avenue corridor and promised to treat the area as an emerging market. In a way, they were true to their word: 20 years later, parts of South Los Angeles still have not emerged.
The designer then endorsed the checks and sent them on to a fundraiser for Edwards' 2008 campaign.
Decrying the gas tax — as if the levy was the real culprit for high energy prices — has become such a common theme for populist politicians that the public might be forgiven for actually believing it to be true. In reality, Maryland's gas tax has remained unchanged since 1992, when it represented about 21 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The tax would have to be raised by nearly 50 cents per gallon for that percentage to still hold true today.

"What we hear on the other side, is that banks aren't lending," said Julie Stackhouse, the Federal Reserve of St. Louis' senior vice president and managing officer of banking supervision. "There's always this tension at this point of the cycle."
But people were hearing each other. As Teletha Benjamin put it at the end of the discussion at her table: "The most important thing we’ve discovered tonight is what we agree about.”
Although revenue from such fees continues to rise, an airline consulting firm predicted last week that they would generate no more than 30% of the total operating revenue for most airlines — not enough to do away with airfares.

Angelo Fuster, a communications company owner with deep roots in DeKalb and Atlanta politics, said there will be some voters who simply don’t want any new tax, or who have no faith in government’s ability to run the program.
In the U.S., babies are rarely born with HIV because most HIV-positive pregnant women here have access to HIV treatment and counseling. In developing countries, maternity programs with a PMTCT component like ours in Luwingu provide an opportunity for mothers be tested for HIV (as well as other dangerous conditions for pregnant women) and to take the steps needed for them and their babies to live healthy lives; as well as for communities to gain productive members instead of incurring yet more losses.
What high school sports mean to me: I really like the family environment that comes with the team and the ability to push yourself against the people you get to know over those four years.
"The conflict along the Rwanda and Congolese border has gone on too long and (with) catastrophic consequences," Ban said. "We need peace (and) an end to fighting so that the region's people can enjoy a measure of stability and prosperity."

2. Courtney Upshaw, OLB/DE, Alabama, 6-1½, 272. His best fit likely is in a 3-4 defense. Alabama coach Nick Saban has told teams he thinks Upshaw can be an outside linebacker and defensive end, but teams have to look at the game video because he has not fared as well as others in workouts.
A little national pride at the U.S. Open too much to ask? We’ll go with Fish, who arrives for the first time as the highest-ranked American, and big-serving Isner. Fish reached the final in Montreal, losing to Djokovic in three sets, and he would seem to be the best hope for U.S. tennis’ first Grand Slam winner since 2003. No, really, 2003. And Isner, whose game is most devastating on hard courts (despite his notoriety at Wimbledon last summer), can pose major problems for any of the top players. Just look at the way he dismantled one-time American darling Andy Roddick this past week (7-6, 6-4 in Winston-Salem).
Earlier studies tested Teriflunomide alone and in addition to interferon beta. They also tested it in two doses, 7 mg and 14 mg.
Since then, the office has recommended that the property be rezoned from its existing DR 16 category, which allows for 16 units per acre, to RAE 1 and BL CCC, designations that would allows for an apartment building with as many as 40 units per acre — and some commercial retail space.
MacDonald noted that the centers had a strong last-minute sales surge, and this past weekend, business has been strong. She added that 85 percent of shoppers are buying, 10 percent are exchanging and about 5 percent are returning items.

Smith had a couple of old friends help him in the second period when Nashville twice hit posts, but players in both locker rooms acknowledged he was the difference in the series.
In 2007, Glennon pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony, a crime that carries a maximum three-year prison term.
An autopsy was pending Thursday night and no cause of death was immediately known.
That the dextrous Clark is a latter-day electric guitar hero is also well known. Whatever her marketing people want to call it, "Strange Mercy" is a prog-rock album -- there are echoes of Howe, Fripp, Wakeman, Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush all over this disc. But a big difference between "Strange Mercy" and the two discs that preceded it is that the arrangements, as imaginative as they are, don't make the songs. Clark can strip all of them back to acoustic guitar and voice, and they all still work. Here's a clip of Clark doing just that: sitting in a studio and strumming her way through "Year of the Tiger," my favorite song from "Strange Mercy." There's too much fret noise and Clark does not look thrilled with her performance. It doesn't matter. This version is, in its quiet way, just as intense as the one on the Poll-winning album.
New Orleans struggled to hold off a 6-7 Atlanta team that was missing injured stars Matt Ryan and Michael Turner. The result was in doubt until Vilma came up with a crushing fourth-down hit on Jason Snelling, stopping him a yard short of the marker with just over a minute remaining.
As is the case with Herman Melville's 1851 novel on which it is based, "All Girl Moby Dick" doesn't really kick in until Ishmael and Queequeg board the whaling ship Pequod and meet that wack-job extraordinaire, Captain Ahab, played here with a wonderfully unstable, stump-legged, bug-eyed sense of purpose by Amy Harmon.

“This transportation bill is not perfect,” Oswalt said. “But it’s a good start to try to get some of the congestion out of the way. We’ve got to spend a lot of time getting voters educated about what needs to be done.”
It helps that anyone can file for constable, Johnston said. The only requirement for someone to take the office, should he or she win, is to then become certified by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education.
Drink lots of water. To prevent dehydration, take a big gulp of water after every sip of alcohol. Then drink a full glass of water between alcoholic drinks. Before you go to sleep, chug another glass of water.
On behalf of the New Jersey Assembly, I thank them all for their service.
Schuermann and the U.S. Parachute Association in Fredericksburg, Va., consider Berry's jump to have been the first, at least the first verified one. A man in California claimed to have made one earlier, and the Soviet Union declared in 1949 that a Russian had done it in 1911.
"We're still in the installation/launch phase of this product, and we will be for quite some time," Hamilton said. As happy as he's been about the early success, Hamilton said the bigger sales volumes would come next year.
Somers acknowledged the disappearance of his witness played a role in the decision to offer the lesser deal.
Since his first Derby try in 1981, Lukas has saddled more entries, 44 coming into this race, and has had more finish out of the money (35) than Thompson had starters (24), and more than three times as many as Jones (11). He entered five horses in the 1996 race and won with Grindstone. He no longer pulls the deepest-pocketed owners and rarely gets any client's best horse. Still, one more win on the first Saturday in May would make Lukas, four months of his 77th birthday, the oldest winning trainer ever.

With Pierce retired and the Giants having taken on the personality of their not-so-pompous leaders — Tuck and Eli Manning — there were no brash statements Monday, either verbal or symbolic. They’re only 3-point underdogs right now, as opposed to the 12-point abyss between them and the Pats four years ago. And while they’ve been quick to play the disrespect card even when it would seem to be well tucked into the deck, this time they chose a more measured approach.
Mikan was out after only six months at Optum.
Chica the chicken - in case you didn't know, she's a puppet - is the show's co-host.
Accused of taking her then-5-year-old daughter to a Nutley tanning salon, Krentcil spent the weekend being the butt of jokes, as acquaintances and celebrities took shots at the tanorexic mother.
But the text has been slightly edited, and Portia's comment about the Prince's complexion is gone, making her free to just be cool, beautiful and smarter than all the men put together. And it's hard to hold anything against Linklater's shaggy Bassanio.
Zanotti smiles when he recalls the job and agrees that the experience honed his public speaking style. He needed that at Cuyahoga Community College, where he served as student body president and earned an associate's degree in business communication in 1975.
St. Louis and St. Louis County went smoke-free, as of midnight Saturday.
And then there are the zombies. Zombies are a big thing in firearms. Mossberg, in a joint venture with Zombie Industries, recently introduced a line of shotguns branded ZMB. The shotguns are different only in how they look, with a ZMB logo and splashes of neon green paint.
Much of that gas will be produced through "unconventional" methods, including hydraulic fracturing or fracking -- the pumping of tons of water and chemicals into the ground to break open rock formations and extract the gas. The practice has attracted fierce opposition from landowners, environmentalists and government officials who say it poses the threat of contaminating underground water supplies.

A half-hour drive from Kraft, and a world away, is the U.S. office of Barilla, the Italian pasta giant, founded in 1877. Framed fiori and rigatoni line the hall to its test kitchen, where Lorenzo Boni, executive chef, was busy one morning making macaroni salad.
Pete's, which operates eight locations spread across Tempe, Mesa, Phoenix, Glendale and Tolleson, celebrated its 65th anniversary on March 23.
Some analysts said investors were overreacting to the situation in Europe when they sent stocks tumbling Tuesday. But analysts also acknowledged that the market was due for a pullback after moving steadily higher for months. When stocks go in one direction for a sustained period of time, market watchers worry that investors are buying or selling indiscriminately.
A large amount of attention in Dallas was given to the fact the Mavericks entered the game with a 2-16 record in postseason games that Dan Crawford referees. But that statistic proved meaningless Tuesday as the Mavericks won with Crawford on the sidelines -- improving to 3-16.
Its headquarters, in name at least, is Lutz's Silver Lake home, though the review's 11 supervising editors and 22 subject editors work mostly part time at their computers, wherever they may be. The 400 pieces that ran during its tryout year came from 325 different contributors.

We blew right past these places. The Cruiser Phil philosophy is to get down the hill before eating a full breakfast. By 9 a.m., we'd dropped down to about 1,600 feet above sea level, and the artsy outskirts of Makawao, where our guides waved us over and loaded our bikes into the trailer.
Every player that takes the field on a regular basis is exceptionally fit and, more often than not, makes good decisions with the ball. They are also athletic. Don't underestimate how important that can be. Just because someone is an athlete does not make them athletic. Priory has players who run faster, jump higher and are stronger than their opposition.

Student loan debt has risen above $1 trillion and the average student's debt at graduation now exceeds $25,000, according to the Project on Student Debt. Hoping to keep their own kids from being overly burdened, parents often unwisely sink thousands of dollars into their children's education that otherwise would have gone toward their own retirement.

Housing, which helped trigger the recession, is showing signs of renewed weakness following the end of a government tax credit of as much as $8,000 for buyers. The absence of faster job growth and rising foreclosures are depressing property prices.
Of course, clothing reconstruction has been going on since the early days of punk, when safety pins were all the rage. But it wasn't until the turn of the millennium that it spread from the punk scene into the world of big-city hipsters. Brody, who lived in San Francisco for eight years, says she first saw the look on Bay Area streets around 2001. And the normal progression followed. It hit stylish boutiques by 2002, and then the big chains in 2003-2004.

While chancellor of the Washington school system from 2007 to 2010, Rhee received national attention for her data-driven approach of seeking to improve education. She drew controversy from teachers unions for opposing tenure and promoting charter schools. In the past year, the U.S. Department of Education began assisting in an investigation into whether gains at some schools occurred due to cheating on standardized tests.
On his six solo sets, Walker has often looked backward fondly. “The Rise and Fall of Butch Walker and the Let’s-Go-Out-Tonites” (2006) was practically a tribute to the excesses of the glam-rock era — tales of Los Angeles after dark narrated by a participant-observer trying to maintain his enthusiasm in spite of his exhaustion. “I Liked it Better When You Had No Heart,” released last year, was a lovelorn turn toward Americana; Walker even began singing like Tom Petty. It’s hard to exaggerate how catchy these songs are, or how effortlessly he seems to distill what was best about prior pop eras. His raspy singing voice is an acquired taste, but it’s a fine instrument for his narratives, many of which are not exactly meant to be pretty.

“I am praying that legislators don’t use my error as an excuse to let education reform in New Jersey die. That would keep some special interests happy, but it would hurt our children far more than the loss of grant money,” Schundler said in his statement. “We have an opportunity to increase the learning and life opportunities of New Jersey’s children. We need to put politics aside and do the right thing for them.”
"The federal government has made it clear that their priority, when it comes to immigration enforcement, is people who are both here unauthorized and have a criminal background," she said. "Arizona is saying the federal government should have 100 percent enforcement and because it doesn't, we are going to enact our own laws that allow us to enforce in situations where the federal government doesn't."
The quality of the craftsmanship came as no jolt to Lee. He'd long since concluded that America's best building occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, when skilled immigrant labor was plentiful, builders still used materials found within a few miles of a site, and their work reflected the ingenuity and mores of the community.

Comment: First-round talent. Brockers admitted he was a bit nervous at combine, and it showed. His speed and strength numbers in Indianapolis were pedestrian. He was much better in all areas at his pro day, including 5.15 in 40. Brockers, one of the youngest in his draft class, is athletic and long (35-inch arms).

That said, this first run at budget-making has gone relatively smoothly. Fitzgerald presented a budget that maintains key services despite significantly reduced state revenue, in part because he has spent the past year reorganizing county operations and trimming staff by about 6 percent. He also has put aside money for economic development and other initiatives and to keep a solid cash reserve. The latter is key to raising the county's bond rating, a goal that will translate into lower interest rates and free up money for other uses. For its part, council resisted the temptation to pork up the budget with special pleadings and through public hearings put forward some worthy ideas. Give and take is part of the democratic process, and the new government's maiden budget voyage is more proof that the voters who embraced reform in 2009 got it right.

Redwood Braxton, 67, of Newark, said he loved the music Houston created professionally and that compelled him to attend today’s service.
"What's the risk?" Eyzaguirre asked. "It's that commodity exporters will have a combination that will be almost too good to be true, of high commodity prices and low interest rates, and that they will not learn from past boom and bust cycles. There is a risk of a new bubble."
Comcast has blacked out the Blazers area.
In the first period of Game 2 on Saturday, the Sharks did their best to make it stick. They pushed the bewildered Blues' nose in it, poked them in every manner possible. Charles Glenn had just finished the national anthem. He was warming up to sing Amazing Grace.

By the time Westbrook left the game, a spring training-style clash was underway. Both teams made wholesale changes to their lineup, unleashing the bench for the final three innings of the rout. Yadier Molina took over at first with Tony Cruz squatting behind the plate. Erik Komatsu and Shane Robinson both took to the outfield to replace veterans Carlos Beltran and Matt Holliday.

"I think they should have planned much better. The planning was very poor. Enough wasn't done," Lavita Peyton told PIX 11 News. The subway commuter from Brooklyn works at a hospital, and said she had to walk a half hour in the height of the storm to get to an underground subway station, and then take the subway to work. She usually takes the Q train, which is above ground in her neighborhood, and was inundated with snow during the blizzard.
The imbalance grew even further during President Barack Obama's administration. Tax revenues plummeted during the recession, as unemployment soared and corporate profits fell. The Obama administration also stepped up spending, adopting a roughly $800 billion stimulus program.
I disagree. In the multitude of news reports and personal anecdotes, it seems that the public schools aren't serving the needs of our children.
The main mine serving the plant is surrounded by berms, with vegetation to improve aesthetics, Leonard said. Most of the plant's equipment is enclosed and the conveyor, storage and filtration systems are designed to reduce dust.

He didn't get much help, either, as San Francisco's woes with runners in scoring position continued. The Giants had runners on second and third in the seventh but couldn't convert, and they are 9 for 48 (.188) with runners in scoring position over the past six games.
Most experts saw this coming. The upstart Blues dispatched the fraying Sharks in five games in their first-round playoff series.

For instance, ABC's teen soap Revenge and Fox's dino-drama Terra Nova are both averaging a 2.7 rating. In other words, each show is watched by 2.7 percent of the 18- to 49-year-old population. That is only 7 percent off the 2.9 rating that third-place ABC averages during the week, but it's 21 percent below the 3.4 average for Fox, TV's top-rated network.

The sad part of "Soccer Made in St. Louis," of course, is that you know how it's going to end. Soccer would finally make it in America in the 1990s, but it would bypass St. Louis. Major League Soccer has expanded to 19 teams, none of which are in St. Louis. St. Louis University has won 10 NCAA titles, but none since 1973. The last U.S. World Cup team had no players from St. Louis. The last chapter of the book, dealing with the sport since 1980, is downright depressing, as St. Louis has a brief flirtation with indoor soccer, a failed attempt at getting an MLS team and a women's team that would shut down in the middle of its second season. You wouldn't be blamed for shutting the book after Southern Illinois Edwardsville wins the NCAA title in 1979.

"The only difference, I guess," DeWine says when asked what distinguishes the slaughter in Zanesville and Obama fiddling while the fish swim is: "You could argue that you weren't sure that was going to turn into a crisis."
The ability to work in teams is key. The old military-style of corporate hierarchy has been replaced by less rigid structures where employee input is actively encouraged. As a result, the workplaces themselves have become more flexible. Literally.

But it's still me who has to deal with the snapping and slamming doors every time he can't open a sticky window. Is it reasonable to ask him to find a better way to deal with his feelings when he's upset? And short of leaving the room, how can I respond when he does this? -- Baltimore
Their explanation for this release was that it is due to heavy rainfall and heavy snow pack in the upper northern area. Naturally, as always, the public listens and absorbs what the corps puts out as gospel. However, the farmers and people who have had experience with the corps over many years fully understand the true reasons for some, but not all floods on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.
“Take-home cars can be a sensitive issue,” Aab said. “It only takes one person to abuse it or get caught inappropriately to get everybody in trouble.”
How we move around our country — Cars? Bicycles? High-speed rail? — is a big issue in environmentalism, and "Just Fine the Way They Are" by Connie Nordhielm Wooldridge, illustrated by Richard Walz (Calkins Creek/Boyds Mills: $17.95, ages 8 and up) shows readers that making decisions about technical progress is not always easy. Beginning in 1805 and hitting every new transportation fad along the way, the book gives a history of U.S. roads, from dirt track to superhighway. At every point, there were people who embraced new technologies (bicyclists "claimed the act of walking was on its last legs!") and people who thought things were "just fine the way they were." That's a fine philosophical debate to introduce to budding environmentalists.
It will be interesting to see whether we get through the first day without delays.

Collecting and storing the things necessary for 72 hours without major services is a tall order. According to Joanna Gonzalez of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the priorities should be basic food and enough water, flashlight, first-aid kit, and a battery operated or solar powered radio. Additional items can be collected over time, rather than all at once.
Why it lost money: Look at that budget again — it’s more than twice what even Bond films cost at the time. And Bond films could be counted on to draw a lot more fans than a moody, Depression-era gangster flick.

"Speculators have overwhelmed the wheat futures market and ... undermined (its) value," Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the subcommittee's chairman, told reporters Tuesday. "Excessive speculation in commodity indexes has created losers throughout the wheat industry."
News organizations covering Guantanamo have objected, however, to efforts to close hearings at Guantanamo where such issues might be addressed. In an extraordinary appearance at Guantanamo last month, an attorney for a group of news organizations, including McClatchy Newspapers, argued that much of what might be discussed is already known to the public through government documents that have been declassified.

If a business owner walked into his bank and told the loan officer he was bleeding red ink month after month, facing imminent collapse without an infusion of cash to cover his monthly operating expenses and that demand for his products was in free fall with no bottom in sight, would the bank make the loan?

But with demand for a franchise passer swelling around the league, the interest will be in whom else makes a move to lock up some of the other prospects floating around. The Redskins have already mortgaged a large part of their future to move up and get into the mix for Heisman winner Robert Griffin III, and the Cleveland Browns — still sitting at No. 4 — have not traded down as names like Ryan Tannehill continue to shoot up the draft board.

Washington, D.C. : You wrote on Sunday about the survey that found more "favorable" stories about Obama -- as if that was a reflection of bias in the press corps. Couldn't it be a reflection of reality? I'm guessing that writing that Obama is making people feel more optimistic and has a high approval rating would be coded a "positive" story -- but writing that Bush had a credibility problem and a low approval would be coded a "negative" story. But wouldn't you consider both "fair"? Doesn't this kind of thinking put pressure on reporters to write negative stories about positive events and positive stories about negative events, just to be "balanced"? What good is that?
That's bad news for investors trying to pick winners and losers among individual stocks. But perhaps even worse: Some measures suggest it could stay that way for some time.

Those are two reasons, Werner said, the county decided to give another $40 million to MetroHealth next year. "There was a feeling that we could not cut them back anymore in light of the demands in their services," Werner said. "It's in both organizations' interest to not be running at a deficit."

Smokler's irreverent look at motherhood has drawn a community of devoted parents on the blog, and the book promises more. An excerpt from Chapter 1: "I joined a gym just for the free day care. I drop the kids off and read magazines and blogs in the locker room." Another: "I kiss my young teenager good-bye in the morning as she leaves for school, rising above the hormone-fueled snarling and histrionics. Then I close the door and flip her off, with both hands."

Manny Ramirez was quite a player. He wasn't always the best off the field, but as a pure hitter he was incredible.
Among the things John and Ken seem to find most infuriating is that so much emphasis is given to the programs that might be lost in an "all-cuts" budget. In the daily grind of news coverage, the size of the deficit is always front and center, but California's dubious standing as one of the most heavily taxed states in America is rarely mentioned, Kobylt said.

"European users will be the canary in the coal mine for this problem," Ceraso wrote.

It’s refreshing to see good government in terms of expediting special needs housing."
But there's a real discernible Japanese flavor to Ohio's capital, thanks in large part to the 32-year presence of Honda in nearby Marysville, the international pull of Ohio State University, whose Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum holds the largest collection of manga, Japanese comic books, outside of Japan, and Columbus' lively multiethnic vibe, which culminates in an annual Asian Festival drawing more than 100,000 visitors (May 26-27).

3. Daniel Rosa -- With his loud yellow bow tie, horn-rimmed glasses, Bob's Big Boy hair and his plucky ukulele, Rosa came on less like "The Voice" and more like a Batman supervillain crossed with 5 & Diner waiter. Rosa's teary backstory? He's just a guy from Riverside? Is that any reason to weep unashamedly into the lenses? Thankfully, he was spared the unhappiness of being in front of cameras every week because not a single mentor spun to his defense. Christina and Blake both were close-captioned mouthing the word "pitchy" and he left with this bit of encouragement from Christina, "Just because no one was feeling it is no reason to give up." None of the mentors however advised him to come back with a better song than Neon Trees' "Animal."
“One of the things we do here is we broker insurance. We do benefit plans, financial services, etc.,” Lillie said. “We’ve been in business since 1960. We’re a very proactive, positive organization.”
As for the timetable, that was precisely what validated America's position -- after 20 months of negotiations -- both with our NATO allies and the Afghan government. Obama's determination to stick to the timetable set by George W. Bush in Iraq is what established indelible credibility in Afghanistan.

Kitzhaber has repeatedly said he won't support the logging bill, but he is willing to look at another Republican proposal to draw more water from the Columbia River. The most current version of that bill would eventually generate an estimated 1,400 jobs on farms and in food processing plants. Supporters say that would make a huge difference in the state's struggling rural counties.

“They’re a pretty good lineup, so past success really doesn’t mean anything,” Hughes said. “Top to bottom they have a lot of power, some speed guys that get on base.

It is not my intention here to parse any of those troubling quotes. Let us leave it to religious scholars to contextualize them, to explain how they square with the contention that Islam and Christianity are religions of peace. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that, while both Christian and Muslim scholars will offer that context and explanation, only Christians can be assured of being taken at their word when they do.

Ever since Amarillo Slim has been his name, no-limit Texas Hold'em has been his game. Slim won the World Series of Poker in 1972 after a 22-hour marathon Hold'em game at Binion's Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas. This won him a reputation as the world's greatest poker player. Many will dispute this, but it's a description that Slim doesn't try too hard to discourage. When you play poker with Slim, he warns you he's 'liable to put a rattlesnake in your pocket and ask you for a match.'

You might think the subject too esoteric. This is precisely what the world thought at several hinge-points in history when out of those hinterlands erupted the Scythians, the Magyars, Attila, Genghis Khan, Kubla Khan, Tamerlane and the like. The artifacts on view come from four separate Kazakh museums but originate from digs and burial mounds that date back to the first millennium B.C. These are the embryonic shoots of a culture that eventually and repeatedly overwhelmed the civilized world. I say "civilized" guardedly. These days nobody uses such terms except to controvert them—and, indeed, the curators are at pains to demonstrate that the nomad horse culture of the steppe was anything but primitive. It achieved a kind of perfection, lasted for millennia, and endures in some version in many rural parts of Kazakhstan today.

Always stand right next to the recycling bin to discard the junk mail, and immediately sort material into sections marked for bills, invitations, and items to be filed.

"He's not a great scorer. He's a great player," 76ers coach Doug Collins said. "Sometimes, we equate dollar signs with a guy's contract to how many points is he giving you. I equate it to, `What was a man's impact on the game?' And Dre has had an impact on every one of these games."

Mankin and Mitchell play the subterfuges of their conflict with flair, but it's a thinly developed plot.

Stare took the podium for the second piece, the Suite from "The City," by Aaron Copland, complete with bits of the film for which it was written. "The City" contrasts an old-timey small town with an urban anthill, and then takes its viewers to a suburban idyll. It's not one of Copland's best, and the movie would be forgotten without its music, but it was interesting to hear the score in context.

Bisbee sits at 5,300 feet in the Mule Mountains. Unlike other hamlets that cling to a hillside or nestle in a canyon, Bisbee appears to be spackled into the nooks and crannies of the rugged terrain. Clusters of houses zigzag up cliff faces, defying gravity and common sense. Others flow in and out of gulches and spill over ledges.

Even if it's only for 45 minutes, you need a spell on the water. My plan was to take a boat out from Gansbaai (about 1,500 rand, or about $200; http://www.whitesharkprojects.co.za), about two hours' drive east of Cape Town, climb into a cage and hope to see sharks up close near Dyer Island, a.k.a.

But as sharply executed as every over-the-top element is, there's something remote about the whole package. Bayes and Epp open at such a broad level that it seems we never get a chance to adjust to the world of this "Doctor" and become immersed in it.

The rest of the group eschews the spotlight, although, in a moment of levity, sweaty drummer Tucker Rule did jump out to the front of the stage to pose for some photos with fans in the front row. For most of the set, though, guitarists Tom Keeley and Steve Pedulla, bassist Tim Payne and keyboardist Andrew Everding simply stood in front of their mic stands, occasionally adding shouted vocals to the tumult while Rickly commanded center stage. Rickly twirled his mic over his head like a lariat and either held it aloft or thrust it into the crowd to encourage singalongs, and the audience happily complied.

The problem with trying to establish unity is that it requires that all Americans compromise or capitulate some or all of their values and ideals. And judging from the viciousness and anger of the three recent national elections and the way this 2012 election is shaping up, compromise or capitulation of deeply held beliefs by liberals and conservatives is the last thing either side is willing to do.

But the whole, blandly acted thing just feels pointless. It’s as if Rabe wasn’t sure where to go, or how. So in the second act, we’re told that half the city is on fire, then some characters smoke pot and babble on (“What’s Elvis going to die from?”). Danny recounts a traumatic memory, Pop barges in with pearls of wisdom (“They are a wind that whirls, these young”) and you wish you could put your head under a pillow and block it all out.

While R.J. Vanecko undoubtedly did not mean to kill David Koschman, this case was not handled like a normal police matter.

Step 12: Wash hands for a very long time. Give sisterly smile to woman stepping into rest room. Hear her curse.
If the state removes the homestead exemption from a property, it is up to Baltimore to actually collect the money, and that's no sure thing. The reason many of the houses in question are boarded up is that they are in foreclosure — that is, the owners are not paying the mortgage and already stand to lose the house, whether they owe money to the city or not. In other cases, the owners have concluded that the investment necessary to make the homes livable isn't worth it, and being forced to pay property taxes at a higher rate isn't likely to improve that calculus. Either way, the city could wind up with the deeds to yet more vacant properties on top of the thousands it already owns.

Time Magazine dinged her performance in 1978's "Somebody Killed Her Husband" by claiming she "gets into serious trouble every time she opens her mouth to speak.

Top Picks Analysis: The Titans were believed to be leaning towards defense or the offensive line with their first-round pick, but the team switched gears by nabbing Wright, Robert Griffin's favorite target at Baylor.

Conversely, Martin competes with a relentless motor to go along with superior weight-room strength and solid quickness. He's similar to Titans' 2011 third-rounder Jurrell Casey, a 15-game starter as rookie, and will likely rotate with his new teammate this coming season.

On another visit, I try the fresh salmon ($17). The overcooking issue strikes again – the fish tastes fresh, but it's too dry to offer any substantial flavor. It depends entirely on the Meyer lemon vinaigrette's gourmet sweet and sour effect. On the side, chilled quinoa and bulgur wheat salad is strikingly salty.

As the report highlights, the Baltimore metro area has an awful lot of good things going for it, including an enviable network of colleges and universities; several world-class hospital systems; close proximity to the nation's capital; and, importantly, sophisticated firms, skilled talent and formidable research capacity. These assets should allow us to grow and excel in areas like manufacturing, bioscience, information technology, transportation and logistics, and the "clean" economy — all sectors that, compared to the metro economy as a whole, have a greater share of workers earning a middle-income wage or better without having completed a four-year degree.
"Bee Season," which was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, paints an idyllic picture of the family at the outset. (It does so almost literally -- a painterly glow suffuses Giles Nuttgens's cinematography.) The Naumanns seem as cultivated as they are prosperous. Saul plays string duets with his high-school-age son, Aaron (a fine performance by Max Minghella). Aaron helps his kid sister with Hebrew lessons for her bat mitzvah. Yet there's a harbinger of what's to come when Saul insists that Eliza understand the meaning of every Hebrew word, rather than learn her lessons by rote, and his wife, Miriam (Juliette Binoche) tells him he's being a bully. Eliza's fate is sealed once she manifests her eerie gift for visualizing the words she must spell correctly in a spelling bee. Saul, a student of Jewish mysticism, has failed to find God through Kabala, but he will strive to make his daughter a corrected version of himself.

"This (Stag) closure is not surprising to me. The likelihood of this came up in conversation when I was in London in November. InBev has been consolidating the breweries it purchased years ago from what was then Whitbread and Bass. The UK beer market is in really rough shape with significant sales declines. The remaining international brewers producing in the UK, Heineken, A-B Inbev and Carlsberg will continue to consolidate production and sell off valuable land for development. The two breweries I worked at in the UK, S&N's (now Heineken) Fountain Brewery in Edinburgh and Young's are both closed. Like so many others they were located in prime property sites. So many breweries have been closed in the UK in the past 20 years and there are more to come as Heineken closes the former Courage Berkshire Brewery at Reading (on the M4 just west of Heathrow airport) and Carlsberg closes the famous Tetley Brewery in Leeds. These like the Stag Brewery site in Mortlake will become houses, apartments, offices and shops. In fact Fullers in Chiswick will be the only large-scale brewery left in London and while it is relatively large at about 500,000 bbls it is small compared to the big guys. There are new 'craft' brewers in the UK and hopefully many will grow to take the place of the older independents that have closed."

The administration's proposed spending plan called for a $330 million appropriation for the 14 state-owned universities in the Pennsylvania state System of Higher Education, which includes Kutztown and East Stroudsburg universities. That's a 20 percent cut from the current $412.7 million.
Cho on Saturday in New York met with Andy Miller, the agent for Fernandez, although both parties said nothing was accomplished. Miller said there was never a question the Blazers would pick up the option on Fernandez, even though he has expressed a desire to be either traded or released.

But Union County’s Nacco disputes the theory that a current student is behind the threats. "That’s sort of a crass attitude. The ones who are here like being here. This is disrupting their livelihood and their education. It’s most likely someone who’s not here, who’s trying to thwart other people’s chances at education."
Young said Edwards told him that he had consulted campaign finance lawyers and that it was “completely legal” for him to accept the financial help. Still, Edwards felt that he “couldn’t know anything about this in case he got sworn in as attorney general,” Young said.

She later added that the move to China came because, "Our largest growth opportunities are in these regions, our established competitors are already manufacturing in low-cost regions, and our most serious new competitive threats are likely to come from these regions."
There are two interesting cases that come to mind. One is Billy Swift, who made 71 appearances and posted a 1.99 ERA with Seattle in 1991. Swift was traded to San Francisco and became a starter. Swift won the National League ERA title, but he suffered arm fatigue in late August and made his final eight appearances out of the bullpen.

The native of Rockford, Ill., might screw you out of a sawbuck as a joke, said his friends and family, but you'd get it back and more at the golf course, or when he came back from Vegas after a winning spree. He was no street tough who hung around with a shady element. He was the type to panic over having a small mole removed from his face.
That may have come as a bit of a surprise to Republicans in Washington who have taken a more skeptical view of the student loan program. Mr. Romney had already wholeheartedly endorsed Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, which contains no provision for keeping the lower rate. Apparently, he didn't mean he liked the whole thing (or read the fine print), or perhaps he changed his mind.
His third-place finish came with a commemorative plaque and $100, which he plans to promptly deposit in the bank.

What allegedly happened in State College, Pa., isn't the nation's first child sex-abuse scandal, but it is no less disturbing. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky faces charges related to abusing at least eight boys over 15 years. The furor over how Penn State handled earlier reports about Sandusky resulted in Penn State football coach Joe Paterno and President Graham Spanier losing their jobs, as well as the arrest of two other university officials on perjury charges.

"I don't make unconventional stories, I don't make non-linear stories. I like linear storytelling a lot. Chris Nolan is brilliant at non-linear storytelling, between his two great masterworks ("Memento" and "Inception"), really. That was non-linear storytelling. I appreciate non-linear storytelling and I go to a lot of movies that have that, but I don't do it. I haven't done that myself. And so I'm much more traditional in how a story should lay out, although there's no law or rule about telling a story."

“Usually in overtime the word is, in the dressing room, whenever you have a chance to put the puck on net you throw one on net, you never know what can happen, a lucky bounce, whatever. You crash the net and find the loose puck. The way we had played in the second and third period, five on five, we felt like we were in control of the game and we were skating so well, so we had the same mindset. We have to keep attacking and putting as many pucks on net as possible. We got the power play there and the thing was to try to put as many pucks on net and go hard to the net. We got a break there on mine.”

If Mr. Burnett had done the slightest of research he would have discovered Prepar3D is simply based on the OLD FSX (circa 2006) engine. MS licensed development of the software engine to Lockheed for their commercial use and the license strictly prohibits "entertainment" use, thus the buzz is really a non-issue. Prepar3D looks and behaves just like FSX, you wouldn't notice a difference.

WR DeAndre Hopkins -- Hopkins was supplanted as the Tigers' top receiver by rookie sensation Sammy Watkins last season, but that hasn't diminished his worth in the coaches' eyes. Hopkins also has been a standout this spring, thanks in part to his decision not to play basketball for Clemson last winter. "This is the first time in my life that I've been a one-sport athlete," Hopkins said. With no basketball commitment, Hopkins focused on football in the offseason, adding muscle and beefing up to 212 pounds. He's also been more adept at shedding press coverage and catching the ball in traffic this spring. "He's making some unbelievable plays on the field," offensive coordinator Chad Morris said.
Top Budget panel Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said the food aid cuts would mean 280,000 children would lose free school lunches and 1.8 million people — out of 46 million currently covered — would lose food stamp benefits while large agricultural businesses would continue to receive lucrative subsidies. The GOP plan would carve 4 percent from projected food stamp spending over the coming decade, including repeal of a 2009 benefits boost under Obama's economic stimulus measure that currently awards an additional $57 a month to a family of four.

But the Jets weren’t ready. Last January, the Jets seemed to come up with the game plan for slowing Brady, loading up the field with enough defensive backs to clog his throwing lanes. Clearly, the Patriots quarterback has adjusted: He completed 26 of 39 passes for three touchdowns and a 118.4 passer rating, and did that on a night when he missed several throws he’d normally make in the first half.

Always ask about military discounts before making your reservation or paying for your ticket — train, bus, rapid transit, at bridge or tunnel crossings, at the parking garage, at the movie, the show or the restaurant — whatever, whenever or wherever you're traveling. It can't hurt to ask. You've earned it.

The victim had worked at Michael's Bar & Grill, 7101 Manchester Avenue. Katina Malliotakis, an owner, said that more than $20,000 was donated during a fundraiser for Lampe several days after the shooting. The remaining proceeds will be used to set up a scholarship, she said.
But the championship rings on Riley's hands were the biggest reason LeBron James went slithering out of Cleveland, like the NBA's Gollum, when James was a free agent.

With Vick lined up several yards behind center and taking a direct snap, the package, in theory, showcases the speed that made him the game's fastest quarterback and the first in NFL history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season — he gained 1,039 in 2006.

Q: Do I understand this correctly? The Detroit Tigers are paying Inge $5 million to play for the Oakland A's this year and the A's are paying Inge the remaining change of his contract, which is only $400k? If that's true, can anybody explain how that makes sense for the Tigers? Even if you paid him to sit at home all season in the event you have multiple injuries it would be better than paying him that kind of money to play for your opponent, right? -- Neal Grizzell, Nashville, Tenn.

A portion of the evening's proceeds will go to "STOMP Out Bullying," a program designed to reduce and prevent bullying, a cause close to Gaga's heart. Earlier this week, she went to the White House to meet with officials about the matter.
It's not that Pelfrey was a great pitcher for the Mets. But his durability at least gave their rotation some stability. His longevity at least provided cover for their bullpen. And as they were reminded in Wednesday's 8-1 loss to the Astros, the Mets don't have a replacement they can say that about right now.
Watching the parrots' antics as they clung to power lines, preened and chased one another, screeched, cooed and sometimes fought, Bittner became something of an expert on their behavior, a fact acknowledged by professionals in the field.

Willem Johan Kolff was born in Leiden, the Netherlands, on Feb. 14, 1911, the son of a doctor. Although his childhood goal was to become the director of a zoo, his father convinced him to study medicine instead, and he received his degree from Leiden University in 1938.
Brightly illuminated gauges in front of the driver are uncomplicated, but Ford's touch screen in the middle of the dashboard takes practice. A nice perk: The rearview camera's picture is big on this sizable display screen, so drivers see clearly what's behind them.
So far, so good, at least from the perspective of land development. But the conservatives now in charge on Capital Square bemoan the layering of government in Ohio, which already has more than 3,000 governmental units, each with its turf, powers -- and costs. It may be that massaging Ohio's new communities law, which House-passed HB 153 would do, is the next best thing to a Wall Street bull market. But that could expand the number of local governments and, either way, no taxpayers will ever hear either pros or cons if the new-communities idea is shoveled into a budget thick as the Sears catalog once was. (In fairness, though, each is a form of mass merchandising.) That's exactly the problem with logrolling, and exactly why the Ohio Constitution tries to forbid it.
The U.S. Justice Department began an investigation into Oregon's state mental hospital in 2006. In 2008, the Justice Department warned Oregon that care and conditions at the state hospital violated patients' rights. State and federal officials have been in talks since then to correct deficiencies and head off a lawsuit. Oregon leaders have said they want to avoid having a federal judge dictate what kind of mental health system the state has.

But it's still true that drug gangs are not targeting tourists now any more than they ever were. And even if the barrage of headlines makes it sound as if the entire country were in flames, the violence that feeds Mexico's death toll takes place primarily in just nine of 31 states — mainly along the U.S. border where the smuggling takes place and in places where marijuana and heroin are produced.

Many of the facilities have been stretched well beyond their capacity. The Hickey School, designed for 72 youths, housed more than that for nearly seven months of 2011, hitting a high of 97, according to the report.

On stage, actors were walking through a transition, from a character smelling the approach of snow in New York to the delusions of a character who imagines she's landed in the Antarctic. But the actors, who are reflecting on the snow scenes in"The Empire Strikes Back"as they wait for cues, seemed uncertain of the lighting. Newell never shouted toward the stage. He put his hands in his pockets, walked to the lip and said, more with matter-of-factness than impatience, "I don't think I've ever had a group of actors more responsive to lighting. We'll respond to you, OK?" Then he turned and walked back, taking small strides, his head down.
"I've been completely able to block it out," he said. "It's easy for me to focus on playing baseball this season. Thinking about all that stuff, how to be the best I can be that night, doesn't allow me to think about what's going on in the next year."

John Czarnecki, FoxSports.com: "Michael Brockers is the best run-stuffing defensive tackle in the draft and would have been a top 10 pick next season at he stayed at LSU. He's basically a third-year sophomore. Brockers is a solid young man (6-5, 320 pounds) with a bright future if he remains grounded. He was an extremely hard worker for the Tigers and never disappeared in the big games. With three quality defensive ends, led by Chris Long, the Rams needed a defensive tackle to hold down the middle. When everybody thought the Rams were going to end up with Justin Blackmon in order to help Sam Bradford, Brockers may be disappointing to the fans but it makes sense to coach Jeff Fisher. The Rams need so much talent and they are stockpiling picks, adding the Cowboys 45th pick. This draft is extremely deep between Nos. 20 to Nos. 55 and the Rams will be making three more selections in that range, so they should be getting some quality talent tomorrow."

A: I had them (early) because of a condition called HELLP syndrome (a group of symptoms marked by hemolysis, or the breakdown of red blood cells, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count). They told me when I was in the hospital that HELLP syndrome is common for mothers carrying multiples and it is common for first-time pregnancies. What it is, pretty much, is all your organs are failing and then your platelets are falling. I came in (to Hutzel Hospital) at 25 weeks and I delivered at 26 weeks. I received steroid injections (to accelerate the girls' lung development) and the girls received surfactant therapy when they were born, which helps them to breathe. One of the things March of Dimes promoted early on was surfactant therapy.

"I was really prepared for anything (coming into the season). I was on my toes for pinch-hit duty and part-time playing, but also making sure I was ready to play every day and produce, too."
Commissioner Goodell concluded, as he did with the Saints' non-player employees, that it was appropriate to focus on those individuals who had a higher degree of responsibility and whose conduct warranted special attention. While a significant number of players participated in the pay-for-performance program, whether by contributing funds to the pool or collecting cash rewards, the players disciplined participated at a different and more significant level, Commissioner Goodell noted.

Currently shooting .456 from deep, the forward needs to make two more 3-pointers to qualify for a spot among the league leaders. The Knicks’ Steve Novak leads the league at .468. If Babbitt goes 2 for 2, he would shoot up to .473 (he is 42 of 92 as is stands). Possible? Absolutely.

There is no specific test to confirm a diagnosis of MCI. Doctors make this diagnosis after conducting mental status testing and by ruling out other causes for cognitive decline such as an underactive thyroid gland. An MRI or CT scan of the brain can detect evidence of a stroke or brain tumor, which can also cause deficits in brain function. And often, doctors have to make judgment calls.

"It was pretty fun for a while there when it was a heavy rivalry," Dolf said. "He came to some playoff games in Detroit. We had some good times. We even drove up from the Muirfield tournament (the Memorial in Dublin, Ohio) -- up and back in one day -- for one of the playoff games. The Avalanche won that game, but the (Red Wings) ended up beating them in the series, back when (Patrick) Roy and (Claude) Lemieux were playing, back when they'd have the big fights.

A: It has surprised me how unproductive the bench has been, and it certainly doesn't get bolstered with Udonis Haslem now starting. It's remarkable how it's come down to Mike Miller or bust.
Bradford was surprised to hear those words. He wasn't expecting to be told to basically stay off the ankle in terms of rigorous activity for nearly two months. It was an indication of the severity of the injury. Once that 'shut-down" period was over, he returned to St. Louis at the end of February and got back in the training room for rehab work with head athletic trainer Reggie Scott.
Best case scenario: The four AL playoff teams from 2010 averaged 807 runs each. The Indians would need to score 161 more runs from last year to reach 807. Full seasons from Sizemore, Asdrubal Cabrera, Santana, Shin-Soo Choo, Hafner, LaPorta and Brantley could make that happen.

At one point, dozens of officers pushed back the crowd with riot shields so they could erect more barricades.
Chuck and Karin Gedge and my wife, Laurel, and I were on our first full day of a weeklong voyage in July on the western end of New York's historic Erie Canal. During our trip, we would cover 90 miles of water through varied and mostly bucolic landscape, all seen in slow motion at about 6 mph. We would visit 10 canal towns, each with something to offer: a museum, a good meal, some historic architecture or simply the embrace of small-town America. And our boat was a self-contained mobile home, offering everything we needed.

"Two pages in particular were graphic enough in sexual description that we felt it wasn't appropriate for the classroom," said Sumner County schools spokesman Jeremy Johnson.
1) Navy’s Pat Kiernan. The sophomore long-stick midfielder plays defense (30 groundballs and 12 caused turnovers), takes faceoffs (7-of-15), and creates offense (seven goals and three assists). Kiernan’s ability to initiate transition for the Midshipmen will be a priority for the Johns Hopkins offensive midfielders, who must be alert to sprint back and play defense, according to Blue Jays coach Dave Pietramala. “I think the thing that impresses me the most about him is his ability to get a ball off the floor under duress and then break away from the pack,” Pietramala said of Kiernan. “He’s a guy that you can’t just go in a game and say, ‘He’s a really good long stick.’ You have to account for him. We have to know where he is when the ball’s loose. We’ve got to understand that in transition, he’s a weapon. He’s not just a guy that’s going to move the ball along. He’s shooting 87 percent. That’s a pretty good year for a second-line middie. So when you look at it that way, we have to be very aware of where he is, especially in transition.”
The county and others worked with these companies, to help them think anew about what kind of services they could provide and to whom; to become more nimble, more flexible, more entrepreneurial.

It helps that Paul Konerko is hitting .387. He doesn't like talking about his productivity because he believes it's, well, unproductive to what he's trying to accomplish at the plate. You can imagine his reaction when I asked him last June about his chances of winning the MVP award. He had better be careful. I might start writing about him as a potential Hall of Famer. He's three homers away from 400 and, at 36, getting to 500 isn't beyond the realm of possibility.

The original film felt obliged to graft on a murder mystery — after all, during the ’30s the James M. Cain brand had come to stand for noir best-sellers like “Double Indemnity” (filmed in 1944) and “The Postman Always Rings Twice” (which would reach the screen in 1946).
"He was a friendly guy, always joking, always picking on me because of my (British) accent," said Ellie Villanueva, a nurse who worked with Clark at the hospital and kept in touch with him after he left.

"The St. Louis Rams, they had an idea," Faulk said. "They acquired me in a trade, and that trade brought forth the birth of the Greatest Show on Turf. Rams fans, I considered you guys what (rap star) Nelly called his crew, the St. Lunatics, because you were there for us. It was so much fun to play with a group of men who didn't care who won the most accolades. All they wanted to do was win. We were the definition of a team."

On Monday, a South Euclid gas station owner told the Better Business Bureau he'd been approached last week by Rodney Bowling of Mastermind about a program that would give station customers a small rebate for gas if they filled out a survey. Brian Fiori was supposed to mine these for sales leads for auto repairs. Fiori said the program sounded good enough that he gave Bowling car repairs and a check for $500.
With irises, you first lift a cluster of them from the ground with a spade or, better yet, a garden fork. Then, carefully work apart several of the fat rhizomes and their roots. Replant them elsewhere, being careful not to put them more than an inch or so under the dirt. (Irises won't bloom if you plant them too deeply.)

The trick to growing your own is to give orchids conditions similar to that in their native habitats. That may sound daunting, but it's often not that difficult. Shade cloth, a pair of fans and a swamp cooler help provide the proper light, temperatures and air circulation the plants in Balchan's greenhouse need to thrive. Yet a surprising number will settle for good light from a window and comfortable temperatures in a home.

That's why it's reassuring to see the Rams bring in a coach that knows what he's doing. As coach of the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans, Fisher put up with all sorts of craziness. A three-part franchise move that had him coaching out of makeshift offices set up in trailers. A salary-cap monster that could only be slayed by parting ways with key, important veterans -- requiring an unfortunate rebuild of the roster. There was a meddling and cheap owner who challenged spending and fancied himself as something of a draft expert.
Howard piled up some good numbers, but he encountered some obstacles.
For his part, Mr. Smith in a statement said he doesn't "recognize" all of what was in the emails and texts between himself and Mr. Michel.

It is on most lists of the top man-made wonders of the world — it boggles the mind to think how workers toted the huge stones that make up the buildings and terraces to the heights, especially because the Incas did not have the wheel.

The tough thing baseball faces is it's such a traditional game. It's in American DNA. But they gotta speed that game up. If you're thinking about baseball long-term, it's too slow of a game. And it's too many trips to the pitcher's mound and too much stepping out of the batter's box. I have a hard time -- I love baseball, but -- sitting through a five-hour game.
Putting these personal documents onstage isn't a new idea, as anyone who has seen Griffin Theatre's touring production of "Letters Home," which also features correspondence from soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, can attest. But Elizabeth Margolius and Terry McCabe's decision to intersperse the contemporary experiences of soldiers on the front with a moving selection of Civil War-era songs — from well-known classics such as "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" to somewhat lesser-known ballads such as Stephen Foster's "Was My Brother in the Battle?" — adds undeniable emotional heft. Classic spirituals such as "Michael, Row the Boat Ashore" remind us of the human cost of slavery.

Yauch, who was 47, achieved fame with the Beastie Boys, but as their fame grew he directed his energy toward his lifelong passion: Buddhism and Tibetan independence. While he and his fellow Beastie Boys Mike Diamond (Mike D) and Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) continued to transform rap music through classics like "Paul's Boutique," "Check Your Head" and "Ill Communication," Yauch helped tether the group with his rhymes about peace, enlightenment and other topics far removed from the party-rap of the Beastie Boys' early music.

"I like the fact our guys played hard," Brown said. "We seemed to be confident. We didn't start very well, but they handled that part of adversity and we ran for 130 yards in the fourth quarter, so we finished strong. I liked the fact we took care of the ball. I didn't like that we didn't have any takeaways and didn't create any field position with our defense, or field position or points with our kicking game."

Ultimately, “The Descendants” is about how little we really know about people – not only the ones we’re closest to, but ourselves, as well. We all have secret sins, and secret strengths.

TWO pumpkins and a jolly scarecrow decorated the front porch of the house, a white clapboard Colonial in Farmington, Maine. A sugar maple tree in the frontyard had started to lose its leaves, and two boys were turning somersaults underneath it into a pile of scarlet and gold, a Dalmatian puppy yapping noisily as it tried to join in the fun.
It replaces a 1982 rule that was meant to protect forests but failed to prevent widespread damage from intensifying wildfires, insect epidemics, climate change and human population growth.
Sumner denied the request.
While realistically this is still so -- unless American voters are prepared to dispense with Medicare, Social Security, the Federal Reserve Board and even our existence as a sovereign nation-state -- at least rhetorically conservatives have a narrative advantage. That is, their story of individual freedom and tyrannical government enjoys a privileged place in the lexicon because of its association with our political origins.
What it doesn’t have are vodka flavors such as Atomic Hots, Cake, Gummy and Whipped Cream. Pinnacle’s sales this year are expected to exceed 3 million 9-liter cases; the brand is the fourth largest imported vodka brand in the U.S.

The 14th Amendment "could have easily have said you're a citizen if you owe your allegiance, but our Constitution doesn't say that," he said. "It says if you're born here, and you're not a diplomat's child, then you become a citizen, and that's the way its been for 100 years."

From a tax perspective, the mortgage-interest can be quite valuable to a couple with no kids, a single person buying a home and to many families. Annual interest payments can easily total more than the annual deduction for a couple ($11,600 in 2011) and most singles ($5,800 in 2011).

The pair's victory in the competition, in early 2004, was a serious blow to Libeskind's master plan and its notion of a submerged memorial; combined with the decision by developer Larry Silverstein to take 1 World Trade Center (originally called the Freedom Tower) away from him and hand it to Childs, it essentially left Libeskind as a spectator at the site the general public continues to closely associate with him.
Notes: Riley said players will take a few days off before diving into offseason workouts, and seven coaches will hit the recruiting trail Sunday.

The ribbon had no sooner been cut than the mad dash was on, as dozens of local schoolchildren scurried to see if the city's newest fun spot met their approval.
I am one of the lucky Pacificans who gets polled via phone every time a parcel tax survey is conducted. In my opinion, these surveys have been "contrived" to get the results they want. They are worded so that you do not give a "Yes/No" response. You are given two choices to reply to the multiple questions with slightly different scenarios. Are you "more likely to agree" or "less likely to agree"? With this survey, the people who paid for the poll will ensure themselves that the results show the taxpayers of Pacifica support the parcel tax. An unbiased survey would ask, "Would you support a parcel tax of $48 to help fund JUHSD"? Yes/No.
It was as an actor on the world stage, though, that he showed his gift for unpredictability. President Reagan called him "the mad dog of the Middle East." Anwar Sadat, the late Egyptian president, once said Kadafi was "either 100% crazy or possessed of the devil." Others thought he was both.

Portrait of a Bookstore (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Take Tujunga Avenue north from Ventura Boulevard, then pull over between Woodbridge and Moorpark streets. You have just arrived in suburban paradise, although it comes with a fatal footnote. Begin by nibbling, sipping and browsing in the home and patio that have been converted into Aroma Coffee & Tea Co. (a.k.a. Aroma Café, 4360 Tujunga Ave., Studio City; www.aromacoffeeandtea.com) and the neighboring bookshop, Portrait of a Bookstore (www.portraitofabookstore.com). Along this block you’ll find vintage clothes, a day spa, a yoga venue, a theater company and gallery, a gelato bar and Caioti Pizza Café (4346 Tujunga Ave., Studio City; www.caiotipizzacafe.com), whose salads have long been said to help induce labor in pregnant women. Within two blocks you'll find at least two casting agencies, one dance academy, one acting studio, one spiritual coach/life teacher and Woodbridge Park, which has a playground, a few shaded picnic tables and a big patch of grass. For the footnote, walk to the nearby Italian restaurant and jazz club. That's Vitello's (4349 Tujunga Ave., Studio City; www.vitellosrestaurant.com), where actor Robert Blake brought his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, for dinner on May 4, 2001, shortly before she was shot to death nearby. A criminal jury acquitted Blake in the killing in early 2005, but later that year a civil jury found him liable for Bakley's wrongful death and awarded her children $30 million in damages, later reduced to $15 million by an appeals court. Blake filed for bankruptcy in 2006.
Yet Colorado ties for seventh among states with the highest proportion of clinically fat dogs. Colorado's fat cats also place among the top seven heaviest.
And if we are to blame Schottenheimer for the stalled development of a young QB, then it's fair to give the OC just a nod of praise for what Sanchez did in the 2009-2010 postseasons. In six games, with the Jets winning four, Sanchez completed 60.5 percent with 9 TDs and 3 INTs. He played very well in road wins at San Diego, Indianapolis and New England. He also played a good game in last season's AFC championship, completing 61 percent for 2 TDs and no picks in the loss at Pittsburgh.

According to Salahuddin, Booker was also aware that Mazzocchi had given $5,000 to Newark Now, a nonprofit organization Booker founded.
This is one injury I have some personal experience with. I ruptured my right Achilles tendon in a pickup basketball game a couple of years ago. It wasn't a particularly painful injury, but a full rupture removes all of the support from the back of the ankle, making it impossible to bear any weight or push off with that foot. It took about four months of intense rehab after reconstructive surgery to return to normal activity, and I'm talking about the normal activity of a sportswriter, which basically entails walking, watching sporting events and eating chicken wings.
"This is a temporary bypass that will allow us to do the permanent fix," Cotter vice president John Hamrick said. "We really are trying to do the right thing here."

The photos below show what a proper jumper wire should look like. While some TISH evaluators get funny about having the bonding clamps placed on the outsides of the shutoff valves (vs right next to the meter), I don't.

Don't get me wrong: I've attended plenty of local sex parties and sat contentedly in the corner wide-eyed and silent, while the rest of the room enjoyed itself in the most clear way human or monkey can communicate. I just keep my clothes on and blog about it later. I simply don't see explicitly showing the world my private sexual habits as a romantic idea.
The two leading contenders in presidential and parliamentary elections are Boris Tadic and his pro-EU Democratic Party, and Milosevic's former ally Tomislav Nikolic, whose nationalist Serbian Progressive Party has capitalized on EU's economic troubles, which have dimmed the bloc's allure for many Serbs.
We believe that Dallas Dance is the right choice to lead the Baltimore County public school system, and we eagerly await his coming to Baltimore County and building upon the legacy created by Mr. Hairston. Maryland law specifically entrusts the selection of a superintendent in every county (and Baltimore City) to the local board of education. Our selection was made free of inappropriate outside influences. As your editorial points out, no one in Maryland knew S. Dallas Dance before he was hired. Our decision was based upon the public input received during the process and the collective judgment of the individual members of the board.

For Holtz, visiting a nursing home became necessary after complications from shoulder replacement surgery in late May left her unexpectedly without use of her right arm or hand.

Holtz doesn't recall telling anyone at the facility about her oversight job with the state.
A memorandum of understanding can resolve this now -- with explicit charter review language to follow.
Love had a monster March, averaging better than 30 points and nearly 14 rebounds per game and becoming the first player in NBA history to lead the league in scoring, rebounding and 3-pointers for an entire month. But the Wolves have lost 12 of 16 games since Rubio went down, including four in a row to fade from contention in the West. And Love's legs might be going right with those playoff hopes.
It's difficult to break the form-letter cycle. That's because customer service representatives typically receive so many complaints, they only have seconds to review your gripe and draw a response, which is normally a cut-and-paste reply. An appeal to a manager - either by phone or in writing - might have helped Hotwire see the error of its ways.

"For most workers, it is best to exit quietly and not burn any bridges. New employers may need to contact your former boss for references, and loose talk may be the difference between a new job and continued unemployment.

My Uncle Marvin and Aunt Lydia, who lived in El Cerrito, met us in the city and took us for a tour that included a trip over the Golden Gate Bridge, a visit to Chinatown and lunch at Fisherman's Wharf.

That was the side to his story the fans here didn’t know. They had fallen in love with Watson because he is a long-hitting risk taker that always seemed to find his way into — and out of — trouble, one who would make a 330-yard drive look easy but a 6-foot putt ... not so much.

And around the time of the appeal, Ho and Iorio asked a man to strike up a conversation with Hilow at her pub and record it. They wanted the man to ask Hilow specifically what she disliked about Sweethearts. Ho and Iorio recently gave me a copy of that tape, recorded in April 2011. On it, Hilow -- with little prompting -- can be clearly heard making vile and racist remarks about both Asians and blacks.

A program's goal should not be to play for a national championship every year -- a program's goal should be to reach its potential every year. For some teams (like Alabama football, UConn women's basketball) it's realistic to set goals of playing for and winning a national championship.

Now 67, Chris is (superficially, at least) happily reliving the swinging young manhood he may or may not have enjoyed in the 1960s.
